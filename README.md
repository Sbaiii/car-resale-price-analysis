# Car Resale Price Analysis 

This project explores a **used car resale dataset** to understand the factors influencing resale values.  
The analysis was conducted using **SAS Studio**, with a focus on **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data mining techniques**.

## Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends in mileage, power, fuel type, registration year, and resale price.  
- Apply **data cleaning, transformation, and reduction** techniques for better quality and accuracy.  
- Research and document how **data mining methods (classification & regression)** can be applied to predict resale values.  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** SAS  
- **Tools & Libraries:** SAS Studio, PROC SQL, PROC CONTENTS, PROC SORT, PROC IMPORT/EXPORT  
- **Environment:** APU SAS OnDemand

## Key Insights
- Cars with higher mileage show significant price depreciation.  
- **Engine power** and **fuel type** are strong predictors of resale value.  
- Preprocessing (cleaning missing values, handling outliers, transforming attributes) improved dataset reliability.  

---

## Future Work
- Implement predictive models in **Python/R** for comparison with SAS outputs.  
- Expand dataset with regional and brand-based segmentation.  
- Automate preprocessing into a reproducible pipeline.
