# Car Resale Price Analysis

A data analytics project exploring a **used car resale dataset** to uncover the key factors influencing vehicle resale values.  
The analysis was conducted in **SAS Studio**, demonstrating **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data mining techniques**.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Car Resale Prices dataset (CSV format)  
- **Features:** mileage, engine power, fuel type, registration year, selling price, etc.  
- **Objective:** Identify and analyze the main variables that impact resale pricing.  

---

## Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distributions and patterns.  
- Apply **data cleaning, transformation, and reduction** techniques.  
- Use **SAS Studio procedures** (`PROC IMPORT`, `PROC CONTENTS`, `PROC SQL`, `PROC SORT`, etc.).  
- Research and apply **data mining methods** (classification & regression).  
- Document **insights and visualizations** to support decision-making.  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** SAS  
- **Tools & Libraries:** SAS Studio, PROC SQL, PROC CONTENTS, PROC SORT, PROC EXPORT  
- **Environment:** APU SAS OnDemand  

---

## Key Insights
- **Older cars with higher mileage** show steep price depreciation.  
- **Engine power** and **fuel type** are strong predictors of resale value.  
- **Data cleaning & transformation** improved dataset reliability by handling missing values and outliers.  

---

## Future Work
- Implement **predictive models** using regression and machine learning (Python or R).  
- Compare **resale price trends across regions and brands**.  
- Automate **data preprocessing pipeline** for reproducibility.
