# Car Resale Price Analysis

This project explores a used car resale dataset to uncover the key factors that influence vehicle resale values.  
The analysis was conducted in **SAS Studio** and demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and data mining techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Car Resale Prices dataset (CSV format)
- **Features include:** mileage, engine power, fuel type, registration year, selling price, etc.
- **Objective:** Identify and analyze the main variables that impact car resale pricing.

## 🔍 Project Objectives
1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand distributions and patterns.
2. Apply **data cleaning, transformation, and reduction** techniques.
3. Use **SAS Studio** procedures (`PROC IMPORT`, `PROC CONTENTS`, `PROC SQL`, `PROC SORT`, etc.).
4. Research and apply **data mining methods** (classification & regression).
5. Document insights and visualize key results.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** SAS
- **Tools & Libraries:** SAS Studio, PROC SQL, PROC CONTENTS, PROC SORT, PROC EXPORT
- **Environment:** APU SAS OnDemand

## 📈 Key Insights
- Older cars with higher mileage show steep price depreciation.
- Engine power and fuel type are significant predictors of resale value.
- Data cleaning and transformation improved model accuracy by handling missing values and outliers.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Build predictive models using regression and machine learning (Python or R).
- Compare resale price patterns across regions and brands.
- Automate preprocessing with a reproducible pipeline.
